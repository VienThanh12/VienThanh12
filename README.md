## 🚀 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m **Kevin** — currently based in **Helsinki, Finland**. I'm pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Science** at the University of Helsinki, focusing on intelligent systems, software architecture, and AI applications. 

🧠 I'm a **Software Engineer Intern at Nokia HQ**, working in the **Advanced Technology and Incubation Group**. My work involves designing and prototyping **Generative AI solutions** powered by **large language models (LLMs)**. I'm particularly focused on building systems that support advanced use cases like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and other AI-driven research tools.

🔧 **What I work with:**
- 🐍 Python (backend)
- ⚛️ React-style frameworks (frontend)
- 🐳 Docker
- 🤖 GenAI & LLMs && AI Agents (n8n, mcp, function calling for AI agents, openAI agents SDK)

🌐 I contribute to **developing GenAI recipes and scalable architectures**, sharing these innovations across teams to enhance Nokia's R&D efforts and empower intelligent systems that better meet customer needs.

🎓 Beyond work, I’m continuously learning and growing through personal projects, open-source contributions, and academic research. I see every challenge as an opportunity to improve — and every collaboration as a chance to create something meaningful.

🤝 I'm always open to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, engineers, and innovators in the AI and software space. Let’s build something great together.

📁 Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I’ve been working on.

👨‍💻 **Competitive Programming**

Growing up in Vietnam, I was curious about technology and problem-solving since I was 14. This curiosity led me to competitive programming during high school, where I spent more than 5 years practicing my skills in C/C++, data structure, and algorithms over and over again. During this time, I solved over 2000 programming problems, participated in numerous contests, and earned several rewards, developing my passion for programming and building a strong foundation in computational thinking. I can confidently say that I've got a solid grasp of Algorithms and Data Structures, and problem-solving skills as well. Whatever language it is, I can learn it fast and am willing to learn new things. 
But now when I've decided to dive into web development and explore a whole new world of coding! Time to gain some new insights and rock the web!
